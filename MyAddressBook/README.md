# myAddressBook

i had to pracise for a java exam, but repeating the same kind of projects bored me. that's why i started this tiny project.
i just wanted to review basic technics such as JFrame/JPanel, working with text files and SQLite databases. incidentally, i took my first steps with [xChart](https://github.com/knowm/XChart)
